## About the Project  
Algorithmic Geometry is a tool designed to:

- Analyze and visualize geometric algorithms.  
- Solve common geometric problems (e.g., convex hulls, point-in-polygon checks, etc.).  
- Provide an interactive learning tool for students interested in computational geometry.  

## Features
- Interactive Visualizations: Displays algorithm steps and outputs for better understanding.  
- Geometric Computations: Performs calculations like distance measurements, convex hulls, etc.  
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI to interact with geometric shapes and algorithms.  
- Educational Focus: Geared toward learning, with code comments and explanations.
